# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository. My themes are mainly focussed on the Gruvbox
Color pallette.

The current installation works best on the current immutable Fedora distibutions
such as Silverblue (Gnome) and Sericea (Sway). 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tluijken/.dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./install
```
For Sericea, I wanted to stick with the as much as possible with the standard
tooling provided with Sericea, such as SDDM, Waybar, Rofi and Foot.
